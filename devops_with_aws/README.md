# DevOps with AWS

For the Role of 5-7 years of experience
Full-time & remote DevOps Engineer 
Company: VetsEZ

**1. How do you handle infrastructure as code (IaC) in AWS, and which tools do you prefer?**
   I generally use Terraform as my IaC tool of choice for AWS because of its flexibility, ease of integration with different cloud providers, and modular design. Terraform allows us to create reusable modules,     which makes our infrastructure more consistent and easier to manage across environments. I also have experience with AWS CloudFormation, which I use for projects that are solely within AWS.
   **2. Why Terraform over CloudFormation?**
   Terraform's syntax is more flexible, and it supports various cloud providers, making it ideal for environments that use more than AWS. For AWS-only environments, CloudFormation is also great since it has direct support for new AWS services.
   **3. Explain your experience with CI/CD pipelines in AWS. Which AWS services have you used to automate deployment?**
   I've used AWS CodePipeline extensively to automate deployment processes. I usually set up CodePipeline with CodeCommit as the source code repository, CodeBuild for building and testing, and CodeDeploy for deployment. This pipeline has worked well for continuous delivery to environments like dev, staging, and production. I also have experience integrating Jenkins with CodePipeline for more complex builds, where Jenkins handles the testing and artifact management.
   **4. What challeneges you went through ?**
   One of the biggest challenges was handling rollbacks in production. To address this, we automated rollback strategies by configuring CodeDeploy to maintain the last successful version, allowing for quick rollbacks if there was an issue.
 **  5. And few other questions on monitoring!**
